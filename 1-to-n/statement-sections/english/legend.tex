$IT$ $committee$ members were asked to make problems.

There are $N$ members in the $IT$ $committee$ and they were asked about making problems.

But there is a rule: \bf{``The fastest at creating problems creates fewer problems.``}

In other words,
the first one makes 1, the second one makes 2,$\cdots$, and the $N$-$th$ one makes $N$.

Can you calculate the total number of problems the committee will make?
