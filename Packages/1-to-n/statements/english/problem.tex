\begin{problem}{1 to N}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

$IT$ $committee$ members were asked to make problems.

There are $N$ members in the $IT$ $committee$ and they were asked about making problems.

But there is a rule: \bf{``The fastest at creating problems creates fewer problems.``}

In other words,
the first one makes 1, the second one makes 2,$\cdots$, and the $N$-$th$ one makes $N$.

Can you calculate the total number of problems the committee will make?

\InputFile
The first line contains $t$ -$(1 \le t \le 10^5) $- number of test cases.

For each test case, you will be given $n$ -$(1\le n \le 10^9)$- number of members in the committee.

\OutputFile
For each test case output the total number of problems.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\end{problem}
