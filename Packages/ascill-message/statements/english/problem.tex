\begin{problem}{ASCII Message}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

$Mazen$ wrote a message to $Sanad$, requesting a holiday, and submitted it to him. However, $Sanad$ encountered an issue when opening the message. He discovered that the message had been converted into $ASCII$ codes, where each character was represented by its corresponding $ASCII$ value.

In order to assist $Sanad$ in deciphering the original message, we can convert the $ASCII$ codes back into their respective characters. 

$Note:$ The original message comprises lowercase English letters and space characters.
