Let $p(x)$ be a function that converts the number to its prime factors.

example
$p(6)$ $ = 2 \times 3$

Let $t(x)$ be the number of 2's in its prime factorization.

example 

$t(12)$ $= 2$ because $ p(12) $ $ = 2 \times 2 \times 3$.

You are given a number $n$, and you are asked to calculate ${\sum_{i = 1}^n t(i)}$
