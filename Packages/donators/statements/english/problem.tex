\begin{problem}{Donors}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

The Egyptian Red Crescent has a list with $n$ donors and each donor is represented by two variables $c$ is the donor's code and $d$ is the amount of money this donor donates.

Egyptian Red Crescent has $q$ queries. 

Each query is represented by two variables $l$ and $r$ and you asked to get the value of ${\sum_{i = l}^r f(i)}$ where $f(x)$ is the amount of money the donor with code $x$ donates.

$Note$ Each donor can donate many times.

\InputFile
The first line contains $n$ and $q$ $(1 \le n,q \le 10^5)$-- the number of donors and queries.

Each line of $n$ lines contains $c$ and $d$ -- $(1 \le c \le 10^5)$, $(1\le d\le 10^9)$ -- donor's code and the amount of money he donates.

After that $q$ lines each line contains $l$ and $r$ $(1 \le l,r \le 10^5)$.

\OutputFile
For each query output the value described above.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
$f(1) = 25$\\\\
$f(2) = 5$\\\\
$f(3) = 0$\\\\
$f(4) = 0$\\\\
$f(5) = 14$\\\\
$f(6) = 4$

\end{problem}
