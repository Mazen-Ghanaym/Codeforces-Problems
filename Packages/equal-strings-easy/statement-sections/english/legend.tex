$Mazen$ has a problem with his memory he has two strings $s$ and $t$ of the same length and he forgot some characters from them, we will replace these forgotten characters with $\bf{`?`}$.

Can you determine whether $s$ and $t$ could be equal if you replace every $\bf{`?`}$ with a lowercase English letter?
