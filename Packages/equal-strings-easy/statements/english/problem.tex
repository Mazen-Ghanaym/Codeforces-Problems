\begin{problem}{Equal Strings}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

$Mazen$ has a problem with his memory he has two strings $s$ and $t$ of the same length and he forgot some characters from them, we will replace these forgotten characters with $\bf{`?`}$.

Can you determine whether $s$ and $t$ could be equal if you replace every $\bf{`?`}$ with a lowercase English letter?

\InputFile
Only Two lines contain $s$ and $t$ -- $(1 \le |s| \le 10^5)$ consists of lowercase English letters and $\bf{`?`}$.

It's guaranteed that $s$ and $t$ have the same length.

\OutputFile
Output $\bf{`YES`}$ if $s$ and $t$ equal after changing the forgotten characters and $\bf{`NO`}$ otherwise.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\end{example}

\end{problem}
