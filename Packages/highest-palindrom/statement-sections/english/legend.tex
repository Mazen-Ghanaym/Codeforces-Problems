$Mazen$ challenged $Mahmoud$ with a problem. Here's the problem:

You are given a number $a$ consisting of $n$ digits from $0$ to $9$. You can perform the following operation at most $k$ times:

For each operation, you can change any digit in $a$ to any other digit.

Your task is to find the largest palindromic number possible.

For example, if $a$ = $0455$ and $k$ = $2$, after $2$ operations, $a$ could be {$0550$, $5445$, $0440$, $5555$}. The largest palindromic number would be $a$ = $5555$.

Can you assist $Mahmoud$ in solving this problem?

Note: $a$ can have leading zeros.
