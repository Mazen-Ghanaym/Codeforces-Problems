While browsing through $LinkedIn$, $Mazen$ noticed symbols like $1st$, $2nd$, and $3rd$ next to his connections' names, but he was unsure of their significance. Curious to learn more, he decided to search and wanted to share this information with you.

In $LinkedIn$, the symbols indicate different degrees of connections:

$1st-degree$ -- People you're directly connected to because you have accepted their invitation to connect, or they have accepted your invitation. You'll see a $1st$ icon next to their name in search results and on their profile.

$2nd-degree$ -- People who are connected to your $1st-degree$ connections. You'll see a $2nd$ icon next to their name in search results and on their profile.

$3rd-degree$ -- People who are connected to your $2nd-degree$ connections or No connections in common. You'll see a $3rd$ icon next to their name in search results and on their profile.

To better understand $LinkedIn$ connections, think of them as similar to real-world friendships.

Let's assume $Mazen$ is user number $1$.

$Mazen$ will give you $n$ number of $LinkedIn$ users and $m$ connections between them.
He wants you to identify for $i_{th}$ user $(2 \le i \le n)$ the symbol that will appear next to his name on $Mazen's$ screen.
