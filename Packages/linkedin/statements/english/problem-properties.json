Curious to learn more, he decided to search and wanted to share this information with you.\r\n\r\nIn $LinkedIn$, the symbols indicate different degrees of connections:\r\n\r\n$1st-degree$ -- People you're directly connected to because you have accepted their invitation to connect, or they have accepted your invitation. You'll see a $1st$ icon next to their name in search results and on their profile.\r\n\r\n$2nd-degree$ -- People who are connected to your $1st-degree$ connections. You'll see a $2nd$ icon next to their name in search results and on their profile.\r\n\r\n$3rd-degree$ -- People who are connected to your $2nd-degree$ connections or No connections in common. You'll see a $3rd$ icon next to their name in search results and on their profile.\r\n\r\nTo better understand $LinkedIn$ connections, think of them as similar to real-world friendships.\r\n\r\nLet's assume $Mazen$ is user number $1$.\r\n\r\n$Mazen$ will give you $n$ number of $LinkedIn$ users and $m$ connections between them.\r\nHe wants you to identify for $i_{th}$ user $(2 \\le i \\le n)$ the symbol that will appear next to his name on $Mazen's$ screen.","authorLogin":"mazen_ghanayem","language":"english","timeLimit":1000,"output":"For each user from $(2 \\le i \\le n)$ output \\bf{``1st``} if the user in his $1st-degree$ , \\bf{``2nd``} if the user in his $2nd-degree$, \\bf{``3rd``} if the user in his $3rd-degree$.","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \\le n \\le 2\\times 10^5)$, $(0 \\le m \\le min(2 \\times 10^5,\\frac{n(nâˆ’1)}2))$ --- the number of users and the number of connections, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following $m$ lines denote connections: connection $i$ is represented by a pair of integers $v_i$, $u_i$ $(1\\le v_i,u_i\\le n, u_i \\neq v_i)$, which are the indices of users connected by the connection.\r\n\r\nThere are no multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair $(v_i,u_i)$ there are no other pairs $(v_i,u_i)$ or $(u_i,v_i)$ in the list of connections.","authorName":"Mazen Ghanayem","sampleTests":[{"output":"1st\r\n1st\r\n2nd\r\n3rd\r\n","input":"5 4\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n4 5\r\n","inputFile":"example.01","outputFile":"example.01.a"}],"name":"LinkedIn","interaction":null,"memoryLimit":268435456,"tutorial":""}
