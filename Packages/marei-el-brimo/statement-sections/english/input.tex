First line contains $n-(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$- number of watermelons.

Second line contains n integers-$(1\le a_i \le 10^9)$ for all $i-(1\le i\le n)$ price for each watermelon.

Third line contains $q-(1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$- number of customers.

For each customer, there are $j,x,y-(1\le j,x \le n),(1\le y \le 10^9)$

$j$ is the watermelon the customer will buy, $x$ is the watermelon the customer recommends changing its price and $y$ is the new price recommended for it.
