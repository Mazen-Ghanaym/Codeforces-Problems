After returning from ECPC, $Mazen$ challenged $Youssef$ with this task.

He gave him two integers, $X$ and $Y$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $X = GCD(A,B)$.
  \item $Y = LCM(A,B)$.
\end{itemize}

He asked $Youssef$ to return the values for $A$ and $B$.

Since $Youssef$ is bad at math, he asked you to help him with this challenge.
