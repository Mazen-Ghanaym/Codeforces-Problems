$F$or a long time, $Mazen$ did not meet his friend $Mahmoud$, so he decided to visit him at the same time that $Mahmoud$ decided to visit $Mazen$.

$Mazen$ and $Mahmoud$ are living in square grid consisting of $n \times n$ with rows and columns numbered from $1$ to $n$, $Mazen$ is living in cell $(1,1)$ and $Mahmoud$ is living in cell $(n,n)$.

$So$ in each move:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $Mazen$ can go $Down$ and then $Right$.
  \item $Mahmoud$ can go $Up$ and then $Left$.
\end{itemize}

$You$ need to determine whether they will meet each other in any cell.
