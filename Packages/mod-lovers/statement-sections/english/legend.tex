$Mazen$ knows you love $Mod$, so $He$ challenges you with an easy task.

You will be given an array $a$ of $n$ integers and $q$ queries.

For each query, you will be given two integers $l$ and $r$ :$(1\le l \le r \le n)$ and you need to respond with the multiplication of all elements in the range $l$ and $r$ $mod$ $10^9+7$.

In other words, you need to output $ {\prod_{i=l}^r a_i}$ $mod$ $10^9+7$.
