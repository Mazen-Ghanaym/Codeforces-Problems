$Mazen$ is facing a challenging problem and he requires your assistance.

To begin, let's establish the definition of prime factorization:

We denote the function $P(x)$ as the product of the prime factors of a given number $x$, arranged in ascending order.

For instance:
$P(10)$ = $2 \times 5$, and
$P(12)$ = $2 \times 2 \times 3$.

Now, let's introduce the function $S(x)$, which represents the sum of the prime factors of a given number $x$, also arranged in ascending order.

For instance:
$S(10)$ = $2 + 5$ = $7$, and
$S(12)$ = $2 + 2 + 3$ = $7$.

The problem involves having $n$ distinct prime factors and a value $m$. Your task is to count the number of different numbers $x$ for which $S(x)$ = $m$ and we can form $x$ using some or all $n$ distinct prime factors and we can use any of $n$ factors any number of times.

Output the answer mod $10^9 + 7$.

\InputFile
The first line contains $n$ and $m$- $(1 \le n \le 100)$ , $(1 \le m \le 10^6)$.

The second line contains $n$ distinct prime factors $a_i$- $(2 \le a_i \le 10^6)$
sorted in ascending order.


\OutputFile
Only a single line Output the number of different numbers has $S(x)$ = $m$ 

Output the answer mod $10^9 + 7$

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
For the first test case $m$ = 7
we have 

$S(10)$ = $2 + 5$ = $7$

$S(12)$ = $2 + 2 + 3$ = $7$

so the answer = $2$

\end{problem}
