Every weekend, $Mazen$ makes a day called $Tasks$ $Day$.

On this day, $Mazen$ gives his friends a number of tasks to solve.
$Mazen$ has an assistant that collects the progress of solving tasks in the form of
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \bf{friend's name}&\bf{task name}& &  \bf{time taken to solve}\\
\end{tabular}
example:   
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \bf{Hamza}&\bf{A}& &  \bf{40}\\
\end{tabular}

After collecting the list, $Mazen$ comes to see it, but he becomes angry because he needs it to be sorted as follows:

First, sort by the number of solved tasks, the friend with the greater number comes first.

If two friends have an equal number of solved tasks then the friend with less \huge{total} time taken to solve comes first. 

If two friends have an equal number of solved tasks and total time taken then the friend with the lexicographical smaller name comes first.

can you help the assistant to sort the list.
