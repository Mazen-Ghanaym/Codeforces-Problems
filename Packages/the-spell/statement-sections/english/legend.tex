These Days, As you know $Mazen$ doesn't have time to make creative problems so he will give you this easy task.

Initially, you have the number $1$ and you asked to get the number $n$ using these two spells:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume you have number $x$ now. If you use the first spell, then number $x$
 becomes $2x+1$.
  \item Assume you have number $x$ now. If you use the second spell, then number $x$
 becomes $2x$.
\end{enumerate}
Construct a sequence of spells, so you get the number $n$ after using them in order.
