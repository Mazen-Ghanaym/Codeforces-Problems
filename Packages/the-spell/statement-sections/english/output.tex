For each test case, output the following.

In the first line print an integer $m$ representing the total number of spells you use.
In the second print $m$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_m$
 ($a_i$ is $1$ or $2$) separated by spaces, where $a_i=1$
 means that you use the first spell in the $i$
-th step, while $a_i=2$
 means that you use the second spell in the $i$
-th step.
