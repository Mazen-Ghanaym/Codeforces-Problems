You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers.

Consider positive integers $b_1$$,\dots,$$b_n$ that satisfy that for any $i,j$ such that $(1\le i < j \le n)$, $a_i \times b_i$=$a_j \times b_j$.

Find the minimum possible value of 
$b_1 +\dots+ b_n$ for such $b_1,\dots,b_n$.

Since the answer can be enormous, print the sum modulo $(10^9+7)$.
