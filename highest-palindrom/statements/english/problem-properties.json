Here's the problem:\r\n\r\nYou are given a number $a$ consisting of $n$ digits from $0$ to $9$. You can perform the following operation at most $k$ times:\r\n\r\nFor each operation, you can change any digit in $a$ to any other digit.\r\n\r\nYour task is to find the largest palindromic number possible.\r\n\r\nFor example, if $a$ = $0455$ and $k$ = $2$, after $2$ operations, $a$ could be {$0550$, $5445$, $0440$, $5555$}. The largest palindromic number would be $a$ = $5555$.\r\n\r\nCan you assist $Mahmoud$ in solving this problem?\r\n\r\nNote: $a$ can have leading zeros.","authorLogin":"mazen_ghanayem","language":"english","timeLimit":1000,"output":"Output the largest palindromic number achievable in at most $k$ operations.
