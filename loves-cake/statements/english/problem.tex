\begin{problem}{Loves Cake}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

$Mazen$ is living in the point $(0,0)$ of the coordinate plane. $Mazen's$ cake is located in the point $(x,y)$.

$you$ can get the $minimum$ distance betweent two point $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$

using this equation:
$$ \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$$

$Mazen$ will only be able to obtain his cake if the minimum distance required to reach it is an \large{$Integer$} value.

\InputFile
Single line contains $x,y$ $(1 \le x,y \le 100)$ -the coordinates of the cake point. 

\OutputFile
Output \bf{``YES``} if $Mazen$ can reach his cake and \bf{``NO``} if he can't.
