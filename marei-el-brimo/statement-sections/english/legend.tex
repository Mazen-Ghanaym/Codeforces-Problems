$Marei$ is a watermelon seller. So he will sell $n$ different watermelons with prices $a_i$ for all $i$ $(1 \le i \le n)$.




and there are $q$ customers who come to buy from him.




Each customer will buy $j_{th}$  watermelon $j:(1\le j\le n)$, You should tell this customer what is the price he will buy his watermelon from $Marei$.

Each customer will also come with two integers $x$ and $y$ recommend $Marei$ to change $x_{th}$ watermelon's price with price $y$. As you know, $Marei$ is a greedy seller, so he can take the customer's recommended price or not.

After that, you need to tell me the amount of money that $Marei$ will earn from hisÂ customers.

$NOTE:$ The customer will buy first and then recommend changing another watermelon's price.

suppose for each different watermelon you have an infinite supply of it.
