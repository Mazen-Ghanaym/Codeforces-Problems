\begin{problem}{Math Challenge}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

After returning from ECPC, $Mazen$ challenged $Youssef$ with this task.

He gave him two integers, $X$ and $Y$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $X = GCD(A,B)$.
  \item $Y = LCM(A,B)$.
\end{itemize}

He asked $Youssef$ to return the values for $A$ and $B$.

Since $Youssef$ is bad at math, he asked you to help him with this challenge.

\InputFile
The first line contains a single integer $T (1≤T≤100)$ --- the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ $(1 \le X\le Y \le 10^{18})$ $X$ and $Y$ are described in the above statement.

\OutputFile
For each test case output two integers $A$ and $B$.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them
