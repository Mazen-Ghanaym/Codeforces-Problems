\begin{problem}{Mazen and Combinations}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

$ Mazen$ faced a problem that he could not solve in the last contest in which he participated, so he asked you to solve that problem for him.

The problem was that you were given two integers $n$ and $r$ and you were asked to count the number of digits for $\large\binom{n}{r}$

\InputFile
The first line contains $t$ -$(1 \le t \le 100) $- number of test cases.

For each test case you are given $n$ and $r$ -$(1\le r \le n \le 10^4) $.

\OutputFile
For each test case output the value of $\binom{n}{r}$.
