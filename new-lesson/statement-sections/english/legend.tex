Today's lesson is about the series ${\sum_{i = 1}^n i^2}$
and also there is a law to get the summation:

$${\sum_{i = 1}^n i^2} = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \large\frac{n (n + 1) (2 n+1)} {6}$$.

Now $Mazen$ wanted you to evaluate the following expression:

$$\huge\frac{2({\sum_{i = 1}^n i^2})({\sum_{i = 1}^n i})^2}
{({\sum_{i = 1}^n i^2})({\sum_{i = 1}^n i}) + ({\sum_{i = 1}^n i^2})({\sum_{i = 1}^n i})} $$
