$Mazen$ went out on an adventure with $3$ Newcomers, let us call them A, B, and C, and when they arrived at the destination and set up the tent, $Mazen$ began distributing tasks to them, but $Mazen$ did not know how many tasks each person did. 

One day, $Mazen$ found a paper with the words \bf{``No Justice``} written on it, and he found their names on it for each one who had done a task for all $N$ number of tasks since their arrival, but $Mazen$ did not mean that, so he wanted to know who had done the most number of tasks to give him a rest.
