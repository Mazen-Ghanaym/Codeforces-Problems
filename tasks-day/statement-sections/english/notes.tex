$Hamza$ comes first because he solved 3 tasks and $Islam$ second because he solved 2 tasks. but you can see $Mohamed$, $Mahmoud$ and $Mazen$ have the same number of solved tasks but $Mohamed$ comes first because he has the least total time taken to solve after that $Mahmoud$ and $Mazen$ have the same number of solved tasks, and same total time but $Mahmoud$ comes first because his name is lexicographically smaller than $Mazen$.
